This is a simple "roll under stat + stat system".  Action is small in scope, as implied by example actions.  This (in its current form) is a game of action, not a game of nation building.

The idea is simple, but hopefully suggests potential that invites hacking and manipulating.  I will be publishing a few examples of ways that the basic system could be extended to suit different play styles.
