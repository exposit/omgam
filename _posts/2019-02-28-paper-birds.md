Paper Birds is a tiny tabletop game for two or more players, written for the 2019 #SadMechJam.  The themes of the jam were Emo Mecha, so there are some compromises to playability for the sake of "the art" but it does indeed function as a game in its current state.

Take the role of a self-organizing swarm of autonomous kill vehicles, imprinted with the memories and ethical values of the pilot that launched you.
