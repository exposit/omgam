A quick solo riff on Otherkin and 6 Hours to Midnight to get back in the swing of things! The theme is "nephilim", in an homage to my current UMF campaign.

<ul>
<li>Medium-weight theming but easy to reskin.</li>
<li>Dice pool resolution with assignment.</li>
<li>Lots of tables. Not really that much new there.</li>
<li>Scene-based, with a simple metered chain of plot events.</li>
</ul>
