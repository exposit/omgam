Fading Light is a short sci-fi game for solo-play, but can be adapted to GM/Player or Collaborative play with a little creativity.  

Make a small subway-style map of a few star systems, evolve their cultural level, adjust for light speed lag, and travel around sowing and mining singularities.  Multiple ending conditions, and possibly a foundation for larger games.
