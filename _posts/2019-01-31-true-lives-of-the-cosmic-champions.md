True Lives of the Cosmic Champions is a game about an endless war against monsters from beyond the solar system, and the immortal champions who cannot lose against this threat, but also cannot win. Can you maintain the drive to keep going and keep fighting? Can your bonds with the other Champions enable you to pull through? Or will your apathy and ennui become overwhelming?
