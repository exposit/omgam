Let someone else pass by in the night is a short, tabletop game for two players.  It was written for the 2019 #CozyGameJam by Riverhouse Games.

This game is a brief exploration of Maslow's hierarchy of needs and positive sum outcomes in game theory.

Inspirations for this game include Sandahl Bergman's moving monologue in a certain film from 1982, and the dynamics between Calypso and Odysseus which are best described in Emily Wilson's amazing translation of the Odyssey.
