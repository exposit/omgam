You’re a small group of 20-somethings living in a sprawling city, trying to work out what you’re doing with your lives.

You rent a house together - an Edwardian terrace with a ratty front garden and faded wallpaper.

Something alien has taken up residence there - in the attic, or a shed, or the basement, or a cupboard. Its presence is warping the house, in ways you can't fully convince yourselves are supernatural.

Will you work together to investigate the horror and push it back? Or will you be too burned out, cash-strapped or terrified to stop it from claiming and devouring you all?
